	<h1>Crags</h1>
	<p>There are at least five crags in consideration. Personally, I would very much like to go to <a href="#dovedale">Dovedale</a> first and then go to a different crag. This would mean an early morning but I feel like that won't be a huge issue for you as you wake up objectively too early. The rest of the crags can be split into mostly trad with some level of multi-pitch routes, or a quarry. The choice is ultimately yours in what we do since you're less comfortable with the stupid shit I do.</p>

				<h2>Dovedale</h2>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>Dovedale is a National Trust property ear Ilam. It's in a valley and has a wide range of climbs. Unfortunately, the area is quite overgrown now and several previously good routes are overgrown and unclimbable. The area of interest here is Silicon Wall and Reynold's Arch. Silicon Wall has a good trad warm up (2★ HS 4b) that we would both need to do due to length. Reynold's Arch has a route I've tried twice and have subsequently left gear on the wall (cheap mallions so not a reason to go). It's a 3★ 6b+ sport route and I'd really like to do it at some point. That does not mean it has to be done in this trip it would just be a nice added extra.</p>
				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>Because it's a National Trust property, the approach is very simple. It's a well looked after path, but does have some minor inclines and declines.</p>
				<h4 class="text-warning">Warning</h4>
				<p>Something to note is that an extra trip to Dovedale would add about an hour minimum to the trip. If planned properly this would be fine, but it would mean a longer day.</p>

				<h2>Wildcat</h2>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>Wildcat is a valley crag just south of Matlock. It's got a lot of climbs in a grade range we could achieve, but is mostly trad multi-pitch routes. I am more than happy to do some trad multi-pitch routes, but I don't feel comfortable pushing my limits on a trad route considering my experience with the gear. There are routes I am happy doing however.</p>
				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>The approach is pretty easy and is one of the reasons the crag is so popular so this shouldn't be a problem. The land is privately owned so we just have to not step of the paths basically.</p>
				<h4 class="text-warning">Warning</h4>
				<p>This is a very popular crag because of location and ease of access. It may happen that we go there and the routes we want to/can climb are unavailable and we'll have to move</p>

				<h2>High Tor</h2>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>High Tor is very close to WildcatIt has a similar grade distribution is slightly harder. There are routes within our grade range, but less so that Wildcat. It's worth noting here that there's a lot of crags in this valley. Several of these are trad with the main two being Wildcat and High Tor and the others are predominantly single pitch in a feasible grade but with not as well starred routes. There are also some quarries with sport routes, also not so well starred, but all with easy access</p>
				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>It's really easy, pretty short, but just wear some good shoes because why not</p>

				<h2>Water-cum-Jolly</h2>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>This is a sport route only crag, and a big one at that. It's next to a river so we'd have to be careful of flooding, but has some really good climbs. There's enough routes that it would be pretty unlucky for us to have people on climbs we wanted to do so it's a pretty safe bet.</p>
				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>Depending on where we park, the approach is either a fairly short walk or about half an hour at a guess. Either walk is pretty simple but wear good shoes.</p>
				<h4 class="text-warning">Warning</h4>
				<p>As said above, there is the possibility that some of the crag is inaccessible due to flooding. I can track this online and should be manageable.</p>

				<h2>Hen Cloud</h2>
				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>Hen Cloud is a popular trad crag with some shorter but very good routes. It's fairly out of the way and has two other large crags within walking distance. However due to the out-of-the-way-ness, it's quite exposed (the second and third photo above are Hen Cloud)</p>
				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>The approach is a fairly short walk if we can get some good parking, but otherwise about 20 minutes max I guess maybe don't take that as fact.</p>
				<h4 class="text-warning">Warning</h4>
				<p>It's exposed. If it starts winding or being rainy then we will feel it unless we're sheltered behind the crag somehow. It's also entirely trad so you'd be doing a lot of seconding and then we walk down after every climb which would mean bringing shoes with us up the climb somehow maybe not sure.</p>

	<h1>Date</h1>
	<p>If I understood correctly, and I probably didn't, We have roughly the 11<sup>th</sup> to the 24<sup>th</sup> expect the 16<sup>th</sup> and some dates in August. I would recommend doing climbing when it's a decent temperature so probably this month. Predicting weather more than 7 days in advance is borderline impossible as of current so I suggest the 13<sup>th</sup> or 14<sup>th</sup> with the option to postpone t0 the 19<sup>th</sup> or 22<sup>nd</sup>?</p>
